## Changelog
### Version 1.04
* NEW: Added aria-hidden and aria-expanded to elements

### Version 1.03
* NEW: Added `.sh-link` and `.sh-content` as a standard class name on top of the type specific class name.
* NEW: Added do_shortcode() to allow shortcode to be parsed within ShowHide

### Version 1.02
* FIXED: Some theme uses `.hide` as `display: none` and hence I have changed `.show` to `.sh-show` and `.hide` to `.sh-hide` to advoid conflicts.

### Version 1.01
* NEW: Added additional `show` or `hide` class to the link and content depending on the visiblity of the content to allow more precise CSS styling.

### Version 1.00 (01-05-2011)
* FIXED: Initial Release

1. You can style the content via CSS that is generated by the plugin. Here is a sample of the generated HTML. Note that pressrelease is the default type.
<code>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a href="#"&gt;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;span id="pressrelease-toggle-1"&gt;Show Press Release (4 More Words)&lt;/span&gt;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;div id="pressrelease-content-1" class="sh-content pressrelease-content sh-hide" style="display: none;"&gt;Content&lt;/div&gt;
</code>
